# LdapConnector
LDAP Connector â€“ A quick way to login and get user details from a LDAP AD or Open LDAP server.

As part of creating a Single Sign On (SSO) solution to Open LDAP and Active Directory (AD) I needed to validate users 
against their LDAP User Name and Password.  I also wanted to pull some basic user information like their display name, 
Email address and Group Membership.

This composer package provides that very limited LDAP functionality, implemented with a consistent interface across 
both AD and Open LDAP.

This package also forces TLS only connections to both LDAP and AD, allowing the public TLS certificate to be provided 
via a file path.  In today's insecure world, this package requires a TLS connection to the LDAP server.

## Usage Example

```php

use JStormes\Ldap\Connector\Connector;
use JStormes\Ldap\LdapAdapter\LdapAdapter;
use JStormes\Ldap\SchemaAdapter\SchemaAdapterOpenLDAP as SchemaAdapter;
use Psr\Log\NullLogger;

$serverString = "LOOPBACK:us.loopback.world:DC=us,DC=loopback,DC=world";

$ldapAdapter = new LdapAdapter();
$schemaAdapter = new SchemaAdapter($serverString);
$logger = new NullLogger();

$connector = new Connector($ldapAdapter, $schemaAdapter, $logger);
$username = 'testUser';
$password = 'test';
$isConnected = $connector->connect($username, $password);
$user = $connector->getUserEntity();

$userName = $user->getUserName();
$dispalyName = $user->getDisplayName();
$email = $user->getEmailAddress();
$groups = $user->getUserGroups();
